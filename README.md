## Visual Question Answering in the Medical Domain

&nbsp;
  The year 2018 witnessed the inauguration of a special challenge for VQA in the medical domain under the name: the VQA-MED challenge [1], which was organized by the reputable ImageCLEF conference [2]. In 2019, the second installment of the VQA-MED challenge [3] is launched and its test dataset currently is available publicly [4].

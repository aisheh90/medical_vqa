## Visual Question Answering in the Medical Domain

&nbsp;
The year 2018 witnessed the inauguration of a special challenge for VQA in the medical domain under the name: the VQA-MED challenge [1],
which was organized by the reputable ImageCLEF conference [2]. In 2019, the second instalment of the VQA-MED challenge [3] is launched
and its test dataset currently is avialable publicly [4].
